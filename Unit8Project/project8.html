<h1>Part 1: Responsive Website Research and Comparisons</h1>
	<br>
	<h2>Site 1: <a href="http://www.teehanlax.com">Teehan+Lax</a></h2>
	<p>After exploring both the mobile and desktop sites for Teehan+Lax's, it becomes apparent quickly that both have essentially the same layout, but the mobile version is merely shrunk to fit the page elements. The typography style remains the same across both sites. Teehan's desktop and mobile site homepage consist of their logo (in the top lefthand corner) and hamburger navigation (located on the top right corner of both pages). The hero image on the desktop site looks down on a pair of hands, a coffee mug and a notebook, typical physical desktop elements one might find near their computer. The caption is a link offering "See the Making of Medium" (which we can assume is a project of theirs). The bottom of the homepage (which does not scroll), contains a single line stating "We help you make products your customers will use." Followed by the clearly actionable, colored text: "Learn More", which I assume is to encourage exploration. Alternatively, the hero image on the mobile site consists of a side view of hands tapping on a tablet. The caption for the photo is more specific than the desktop site stating that the company helps their clients to bringing digital products and services to the marketplace. This is followed by a "See What we Do" boxed link element. The mobile homepage does not scroll either, but there is a link to a Blog link Teehan+Lax intended to attract single finger tapping.</p>
	<p>The desktop site is responsive, as the browser window is adjusted, the page elements collapse and rearrange to fit the same stacked format as the mobile site. When the hamburger navigation bar is selected on the mobile, the four quick link options are About, Jobs, Blog and Contact. The quick links for the desktop navigation are a little more expanded offering What We Do, Tools, Careers, Labs, Blog and Contact Us sections. Underneath is a a listing of "Things We've Made" (this section is the same on both the desktop and mobile site), followed by links to social networking sites where you can share the content (same listing on both desktop and mobile pages). The navigation and logo stayed fixed as you scroll down this page, and in both formats, each time the logo is tapped again it takes users to a new section of the site to explore. There are images on both, but the pages is predominately text. It is also important to note that there is not sidebar navigation on this site. Also, the mobile site does not respond to pinching, only basic gestures such as tapping to select.
	<br>
	<h2>Site 2: <a href="http://www.thomasduval.com/">Thomas Duval Photography</a></h2>
	<p>The Thomas Duval website is another that was clearly designed as a responsive one. The logo style, text and background colors and typography style are the same on both sites. When the browser window is adjusted, the site shrinks and photographs and content stack to match the mobile site formatting exactly. The homepage for the desktop site offers a centered text logo, About and Contact quick links located on the same line on the top right section of the page, and a navigation bar on the right side of the page. When the browser shrinks, the About and Contact elements move down a line and center themselves below the Thomas Duval Logo. On the desktop and mobile sites, when the About or Contact link selected, the homepage content moves down to make space for the text, the disappears again when the "X" box is closed on either site format.</p>
	<p>Thomas Duval's homepage is very heavy with rectangular shaped photograph books, all of which are titled, some of which are located in varying rectangular sizes on the same line. On the desktop, when the cursor rolls over each titled photo book, the image changes to reveal several other photographs from the collection as the cursor continues to scroll, stopping only when the cursor does. The mobile design for the site does not offer this same level of functionality. The books are in the same order with the same text style and titles, but when the cover image is touched and held it becomes another image from the book, but only the same image each time it is touched. Furthermore, the mobile site does respond to pinching in order to zoom in. If the image is selected, like the desktop version, it opens the book in a new page, placing Thomas Duval's logo over a single image that spans the width of the screen, followed by centered text (the same font and centered layout as the desktop site). Beneath, instead of being paired in 2 rectangular images of the same shape down the page as is done on the desktop, the photographs in the mobile design are all <em>square-shaped</em>, and the content takes quite some time to load.That said, Thomas Duval does allow a link back to the Homepage at the bottom of every art book, creating an easier flow for his site.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Site 2: <a href="http://www.sephora.com/">Sephora</a></h2>
	<p>Sephora's desktop site is extremely involved with multiple forms of navigation, quite literally links for their links. The homepage, which is not responsive as the browser window is adjusted, consists first of a horizontal navigation bar along the top left (to sign-in/register, access Account, Beauty Insider (program info), then a store locator and basket (both with icons), on the top right. Below this, the homepage transporter logo is centered on the screen with a search bar located on its left and a changing current site announcement blurb on the right. Below this is yet another round of horizontal navigation, this time with a white navigation bar and black text separated from the rest of the page with a single underline to create hierarchy, with links to the sites primary categories (makeup, skin care, fragrance, bath and body, nails, hair, tools and brushes, men, gifts, sale, brands), then on the far right are bright purple lipstick-smear links for Advice and How-To's sections. Below the line on the left, is another navigation section, this time vertical in nature, of "Quick Links". Floated to the right of this navigation is a large hero image announcing the site's top featured products. There is no navigation bar on the right of the page, but as the user scrolls down with the mouse to explore further, there are additional sections of makeup, such as gifts, makeup collections etc, all stacked on each other and all with images of each item discussed (a very image heavy site). Each of these sections contains and ">" at their right to scroll and see more featured products in the category. Above this arrow in each section is an underlined text link entitled "see more" that users can use to navigate to that category's page. The very bottom of the page contains four columns of small text links to connect users to company information, email signup, gift card and contact details, sales and weekly specials...the list goes on.</p>
	<p>Sephora's mobile design is far less photo-heavy relying instead on easy, single finger/thumb navigation (in multiple forms) to encourage users to explore. The mobile site's homepage contains the same black, white and pink color scheme as the desktop version for continuity, and the typographic style is also identical. The first navigational element is hamburger navigation on the top-left portion of the page, next to a a centered logo and shopping basket icon/link on the top-right (all are on the same line). When the hamburger navigation is tapped with a finger, it opens a new menu over the page content. This new menu, interestingly, offers expanding navigational elements, a completely different type of navigation. If you select "Today" for example, the navigations expands further down to make room for four subcategories: New Arrivals, Daily Obsessions, Mobile Offers, and Today's Free samples.Sephora, again, really does have a great deal of links for their links.
	<p>Directly below (there is no waste of space) is a search box to type in any inquiry (a smart move for users who are trying to find a product description or review from within the store). Stacked below are four more boxes, in two sets of two, quick lookup of "Brands", "Shop" "Account" and "Store locator", followed by another stacked element prompting users to sing in/register for their Beauty Insider account. Underneath these elements, are two larger boxes, one labeled "Today" containing several segmented vertical links to things like "today's obsession" and "mobile offers", and a second vertical navigation box labeled "Quick Links" with more linkes to "Sale", "What's New" and "Bestsellers" section. When users touch these links, a new page opens listing all elements in that category. If you keep scrolling down you are finally met with a photograph of today's special gift, followed by two horizontal box links to locate the nearest store or contact the company.</p>
	<p>Although there is a lot going on on the mobile page, navigation is fairly easy and photo content is only shown when a page category has been selected, limiting the load time for the page...a very smart move.</p>

<h1>Part 2: Responsive Wireframes</h1>
	<h3>Wireframe Design Considerations:</h3>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Where will the menu elements be placed?</strong></li>
		<li><strong>How will users navigate the page? What is the primary call to action?</strong></li>
		<li><strong>What are the color, font, or image scheme changes?</strong></li>
		<li><strong>What order will the content stack?</strong></li>
	</ol>
		<p>After reading the "Mobile First" presentation in the further reading section this week, I thought it would probably be best to re-design my site for a smartphone (since there is astronomical growth in this area). Specifically, I took the screen measurements from my iPhone to get an idea of how the elements would look and best be laid out on the page, and how I could navigate with a thumb or finger without being uncomfortable or dropping my phone.</p>
		<p>To begin, the "About" and "Contact" links will relocate to the top left and top right portions of the mobile design page. These elements will be part of the flat navigation and will not contain a rollover color. Instead they will be bolded and underlined. Centered below will be the Artist's logo (name), followed by a single hero image, in a small square format, centered on the page. The navigation below will be expanding navigation consisting of the categories of "Filmography", "Photography", "Painting", "Blog", and "Buy Prints" quick links. This enables phone users to rely on a single finger or thumb to move about the site easily. Also, keeping with the mobile design tradition of making social networking icons/links easily accessible (so users can share content and hopefully augment the user base), I will place links to the artist's twitter, Facebook (mabye) and Flickr/500px photo portfolio gallery. Including the photo gallery as an outside link also reduces the time it will take for my page to load. </p>
		<p>In terms of color, font and image scheme, after reviewing the responsive web development online, I think it is the best idea to keep the font family and color scheme the same on both the desktop and mobile sites. This will help encourage a sense of continuity in users, instead of confusion. I did consider making the backgroud dark and the font light, but the current colors are clean making page elements easier to identify. The images and videos will be limited to particular pages, such as the "Filmography", "Photography" and "Painting" page sections. Although it took time for the images on Thomas Duval's site to load, and I will contain links on all pages to the social networking sites, including the artist's complete, external portfolio, I think it is crucial to have some of the best photographs, trailers and paintings directly on this site in order to help give users a quick taste of who the artist is and to inspire further interest. This content will stack in square form, one element below another, equally spaced to give a sense of balance and flow. A finger would be used to scroll up and down the page (though there would be no official navigation bar to save screen space). Pinching would be another gesture used to zoom in on specific photographs and page elements.</p>
