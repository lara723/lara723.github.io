	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I am the Assistant Financial Controller of a private club in New York City by day, and the Co-Owner and Producer of a Brooklyn-based independent movie and photography production company by night. I currently live in Brooklyn. I studied Computer Science (a few credits shy of a minor) and Business in college, but primarily became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development over the past few years while attempting, in great frustration, to build the website for my production company from a series of templates that did not seem to offer what I needed. I also handle a lot of the technical issues for the Club where I work and thought that, in addition to coding and design, this class would help immensely in strengthening my grasp on computer language and, thereby, dealing with vendors.</p>

	<p>Although I have been in finance for several years it has never been my passion. My 5th grade self hated decimals and fractions, but I have been lucky enough to develop strong skills in finance despite that, mostly born of the necessity to be financially stable while living in a very expensive New York City.</p>


	<h2>My Mission</h2>
	<p>As I learn more about front-end web development, I want to pursue a career in the field of website design, primarily designing websites for colleagues and small local startup companies in my community. I also want to devote more time to my own company, including the film we currently have in pre-production and hope to begin shooting next summer.  For my own company, I also want to be proficient at handling the (re)creation of our website, logos and all other things related to marketing and tech.Long term, my partner and I are also focused on the creation of an online news and fashion magazine.</p> 

	<p>I thrive much better in a creative working environment instead of a highly corporate one. I am counting the days until I can make the creative a full-time reality.</p>
